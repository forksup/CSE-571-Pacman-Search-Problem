# CSE-571-Pacman-Search-Problem

A pacman goal based agent. I have solved several of these search problems using depth first search, breadth first search, Uniform Cost Search, and A Star Search.

The goal of this problem is to navigate through a maze and find the one food node. Below is an example on the maze big Maze:

In the search.py file you can see my execution of these algorithm styles. These are used as agents for path finding in the pacman world. 

In the searchAgents.py file, I created problem definitions in order to encode the state space diffferently to allow my search algorithms to solve different problems. Such as the find all corners and eat all food. I developed heuristics which increased the efficiency of the A* algorithm.
