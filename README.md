A pacman goal based agent. I have solved several of these search problems using depth first search, breadth first search, Uniform Cost Search, and A Star Search.

In the search.py file you can see my execution of these algorithm styles. These are used as agents for path finding in the pacman world. 

In the search agents.py file, I created problem definitions in order to encode the state space diffferently to allow my search algorithms to solve different problems. Such as the find all corners and eat all food. I developed heuristics which increased the efficiency of the A* algorithm.
